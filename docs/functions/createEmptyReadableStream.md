# Function: createEmptyReadableStream()

> **createEmptyReadableStream**(): `ReadableStream`

Creates an empty ReadableStream that immediately closes upon creation.
This function is used as a fallback for creating a ReadableStream when the response body is null or undefined,
ensuring that the subsequent pipeline processing doesn't fail due to a lack of a stream.

## Returns

`ReadableStream`

An empty and closed ReadableStream instance.

## Defined in
