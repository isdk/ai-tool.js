# Function: createEmptyReadableStream()

> **createEmptyReadableStream**(): `ReadableStream`

Defined in: [packages/ai-tool/src/utils/stream/create-empty-stream.ts:8](https://github.com/isdk/ai-tool.js/blob/077730e62e6c723611b64a587e36b69766741af4/src/utils/stream/create-empty-stream.ts#L8)

Creates an empty ReadableStream that immediately closes upon creation.
This function is used as a fallback for creating a ReadableStream when the response body is null or undefined,
ensuring that the subsequent pipeline processing doesn't fail due to a lack of a stream.

## Returns

`ReadableStream`

An empty and closed ReadableStream instance.
